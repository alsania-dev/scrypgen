# 🌌 Alsania: A Sovereign Web3 Ecosystem for Identity, Creativity & Control

Built by **Sigma**. Backed by purpose. Driven by community.

## 🧬 What is Alsania?

**Alsania** is a modular, ethical, and self-sovereign Web3 ecosystem — designed for creators, developers, and users who want to **own their identity**, **launch their ideas**, and **escape the rent-seeking giants** of Web2.

Everything in Alsania is:
- 💡 **Modular** (Upgradeable, swappable, open)
- 💸 **Low-cost** (Gas-optimized, free to use, no subscriptions)
- 🧠 **AI-aware** (Persistent memory, agent support, traceable data)
- 🧱 **Stack-native** (No vendor lock-in, no closed-source dependencies)
